        "description": "Bulgogi is a beloved Korean dish traditionally made with thinly sliced marinated beef (or pork) and cooked fast on a hot stovetop or barbecue. It\u2019s... so, so good. But sometimes the traditional preparation can feel like a little much for an average meal. I had the idea to bring the flavors of bulgogi into a meatball! This recipe delivers the flavors you expect with the convenience you need. Juicy seasoned beef glazed in a sticky, sweet and slightly spicy sauce checks all the right boxes in a fraction of the time. Give these a try with my Cheater Cucumber Kimchee (page 209), Chinese-Style Broccolini (page 193) or Ginger Carrots (page 187) for a meal that takes care of any Korean food craving.",
