Process 1 \u00bc cups flour, \u2153 cup confectioners' sugar, and \u00bc teaspoon salt in food processor until combined, about 5 seconds. Scatter 8 tablespoons chilled butter over top and pulse until mixture resembles coarse cornmeal, about 15 pulses. With process running, add egg yolk mixture and process until dough just comes together, about 12 seconds.\nForm dough into 6-inch disk, wrap tightly in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for 1 hour or up to 4 days.\nLet chilled dough sit on counter to soften slightly, about 10 minutes. Roll dough into 11-inch circle on lightly floured counter. Loosely roll dough around rolling pin and gently unroll it onto 9-inch tart pan with removable bottom, letting excess dough hang over edge. Ease dough into pan by gently lifting edge of dough with your hand while pressing into corners and fluted sides of pan with your other hand. Run rolling pin over top of pan to remove any excess dough.\nWrap dough-lined pan loosely in plastic, place on large plate, and freeze until dough is chilled and firm, about 30 minutes.\nAdjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 375\u00baF. Set dough-lined tart pan on baking sheet, line with double layer of aluminum foil, covering edges to prevent burning, and fill with pie weights.\nBake until crust is golden brown and set, about 30 minutes, rotating pan halfway through baking. Remove weights and foil and let crust cool.\nLemon Curd\nAdjust oven rack to middle position and reduce oven heat to 350\u00baF.\nMeasure out 1 tablespoon lemon juice and set aside for the blueberry layer later.\nWhisk remaining 7 tablespoons lemon juice, \u00bc cup lemon zest, 1 egg, 5 yolks, \u2153 cup honey, and pinch salt in medium saucepan until smooth. Cook over medium-low heat, stirring constantly with rubber spatula, until mixture thickens slightly and registers 165\u00baF, about 5 minutes.\nOff heat, whisk in 4 tablespoons chilled butter until melted. Strain lemon curd through fine-mesh strainer into bowl, then gently stir in 2 tablespoons cream with rubber spatula.\nPour warm lemon curd into cooled tart crust. Set tart on baking sheet and bake until filling is shiny and opaque and center jiggles slightly when shaken, 10\u201312 minutes, rotating pan halfway through baking. Transfer tart with baking sheet to wire rack and let cool slightly.\nBlueberry Layer\nMeanwhile, process 2 cups blueberries in a food processor until smooth, about 2 minutes. Strain pur\u00e9e through clean fine-mesh strainer into medium saucepan, pressing on solids to extract as much liquid as possible (you should have about \u00be cup); discard solids.\nWhisk in remaining \u00bc cup honey and \u215b teaspoon salt. Whisk together 2 tablespoons cornstarch and 2 tablespoons water in a small bowl, then whisk into strained blueberry mixture. Bring to simmer over medium-low heat, stirring constantly, and cook until thickened slightly and registers 170\u00baF, about 4 minutes. Off heat, whisk in reserved 1 tablespoon lemon juice.\nPour blueberry mixture evenly over cooled lemon filling. Tap pan lightly on counter to release any air bubbles, then refrigerate until blueberry mixture is set and shiny, about 2 hours.\nTo serve, remove outer ring of tart pan, slide thin metal spatula between tart and tart pan bottom, and carefully slide tart onto serving patter or cutting board.",

    "instructions": "Make the dough\nIn a small saucepan, whisk the sticky rice flour and water until smooth, then cook it over medium-high heat, stirring constantly. It will appear lumpy at first, then eventually it becomes a big glob of sticky goo. When it does, turn off the heat and let it cool completely.\nIn the bowl of a stand mixer with a dough hook attachment, combine the sticky rice good, bread flour, egg and egg white, sugar, yeast and salt. Knead on low speed until the mixture comes together into a sticky dough (the dough may seem dry at first, but do not add water).\nAdd the butter, scraping the sides and bottom of bowl to ghelp the butter incorporate evenly, and knead for 7 to 8 minutes, until the dough is extremely smooth and elastic. The dough should be sticky, but only sticking to the bottom of the bowlas the machine is running, leaving a thin opaque film on the sides of the bowl. It i;s too wet\u2014sticking everywhere as the machine is running\u2014add 1 tablespoon of bread flour at a time and knead again until it looks right.\nCover the bowl with plastic wrap and let the dough rise at room temperature until doubled, 2 to 3 hours.\nShape the donuts\nDust the working surface with flour, then roll the dough into a large sheet about \u215c inch (1cm) thick. Use a 4-inch (10-cm) dough doughnut cutter to cut out donuts. You can do it with or without doughnut holes.\nCut out a 5-inch (13-c) square of parchment paper for each doughnut. Transfer the donuts onto the squares, set them aside on large sheet pans, and cover loosely with plastic wrap. Let them rise again until doubled (this will mostly show in thickness instead of width), 1 \u00bd to 2 hours.\nMake the glaze and topping\nMeanwhile, combine the honey, butter, and sea salt in a small saucepan and cook over low heat, stirring constantly, until the mixture has come to a simmer and the butter is melted. Set aside to let cool to room temperature and thicken.\nMix the cardamom and cinnamon in a small bowl and set aside.\nFry the donuts\nWhen the donuts are proofed, add 1 \u00bd inches (4 cm) of canola oil to a deep frying pan. Heat over medium-high heat until the oil reaches 325\u00b0F/160\u00b0C.\nLife one parchment paper with a doughnut on it and gently lower it into the frying oil (including the parchment). Use a fork or chopsticks (I used tongs) to press the parchment paper down do the hot oil can flood the bottom of the doughnut, which will release it from the parchment. When the parchment is free, remove with tongs. Fry until one side of the doughnut is golden brown, about 1 minute, then flip and fry until the other side is golden brown, about 1 minute more.\nIf it takes way faster or slower than 1 minute for each side of the doughnut to brown, the oil, is either too hot or too cold. Adjust accordingly.\nDrain well (I used a spider, but a slotted spoon would work too) and set aside on a cooling rack. Repeat to make the rest of the donuts.\nTo serve\nDrizzle the salted honey over the warm donuts and dust with cardamom mixture (a little goes a long way). Enjoy immediately.",

Bring to a simmer, stirring to combine, and cook until slightly syrupy and reduced by half (about \u2154 cup), 8\u201310 minutes.\nOff heat, stir in 1 tablespoon sesame seeds and \u00be grated ginger, if using. Divide sauce evenly between 2 bowls and let cool; set one bowl aside for serving.\nTransfer steak to a cutting board and, starting at narrow tapered end, slice steak \u215c-inch thick on bias against grain until width of steak is 7-inches (depending on size of steak, you will need to remove 2\u20133 slices until steak measures 7-inches across).\nCut steak in half lengthwise then continue to cut each half (on a bias and against the grain) into \u215c-inch thick slices. You should have at least 24 slices. Pound each slice to 3/16-inch thickness using a flat meat tenderizer or rolling pin.\nArrange 3 slices of meat on cutting board with short side of slices facing you, overlapping slices by \u00bc-inch and alternating tapered ends to form a rough rectangle 4\u20136-inches wide and at least 4-inches long.\nPlace 4 scallion halves along edge of rectangle parallel to you and perpendicular across steak slices, with white tips slightly hanging over edges of steak on either side. Starting from bottom edge (nearest you), roll steak over scallions (away from you), into a tight roll. Insert 3 toothpicks, equally spaced amongst each slice of meat, into meat ends and through center of roll.\nTransfer roll to platter and repeat with remaining steak and scallions. (Assembled rolls can be refrigerated for up to 24 hours.)\nFor a Charcoal Grill\nOpen bottom vent completely. Light large chimney starter three-quarters filled with charcoal briquettes (4\u00bd quarts). When top coals are partially covered with ash, pour evenly over half of grill. Set cooking grate in place, cover, and open lid vent completely. Heat grill until hot, about 5 minutes.\nFor a Gas Grill\nTurn all burners to high, cover, and heat grill until hot, about 15 minutes. Leave all burners on high. (If your grill runs hot, decrease temp to medium-high before placing rolls on grate).\nGrilling\nBrush grill grate with oil. Place rolls on grill (over coals if using charcoal) and cook until first side is beginning to char, about 4 minutes. Flip rolls, brush cooked side with glaze, and cook until second side is beginning to char, about 4 minutes. Cook remaining 2 sides, glazing after each turn, until all 4 sides of rolls are evenly charred and thermometer inserted from end of roll into scallions at core registers around 150\u00baF (65\u00baC), 2\u20134 minutes more (10\u201312 minutes total cooking time).\nServing\nTransfer rolls to cutting board, tent with aluminum foil, and let rest for 5 minutes. Discard any remaining glaze used for brushing over meat.\nRemove toothpicks from rolls and cut rolls crosswise into 3 pieces (about \u00be-inch-long).

Bring to a simmer over medium heat, add pears and increase heat to high. Bring liquid back to a simmer then decrease heat to low and cook, covered, until pears are fork-tender, about 10 minutes, turning pears halfway through. Remove from heat, and cool completely in liquid, uncovered.\nFor the whole-wheat tart crust\n, whisk together egg yolk, milk, and \u00bd teaspoon almond extract. Pulse 1\u00bc cup plus 2 tablespoons flour, confectioner\u2019s sugar, and \u00bc teaspoon salt in a food processor to combine, about 5 pulses.\nSprinkle 8 tablespoons butter over flour mixture and pulse until mixture resembles coarse crumbs, about 20 pulses. With processor running, add egg and milk mixture and process until dough comes together, 15\u201320 seconds.\nTransfer dough to a work surface, form into a 6-inch disk, wrap in plastic wrap, and refrigerate at least 1 hour or up to 2 days. (Can be made up to 1 month ahead and frozen. Double wrap disk with plastic wrap before freezing. Let thaw 24 hours in refrigerator before using.)\nFor the almond filling\n, pulse almonds, granulated sugar, 1 tablespoon flour, and \u00bc teaspoon salt in a food processor until as finely ground as possible. Add egg, egg white, \u00bd teaspoon almond extract, vanilla extract, and amaretto, process to combine, about 10 seconds.\nAdd 6 tablespoons butter and process until thoroughly combined. Transfer to a bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and chill at least 1 hour. (Can be made up to 2 days in advance, keep refrigerated.)\nRemove tart dough from refrigerator and let stand at room temperature for 5\u201310 minutes until workable.\nOn a lightly floured surface, roll dough into a 12-inch circle, lifting and rotating occasionally to free from surface. Cut dough into 4 even squares, then transfer squares to four, 4\u00bd-inch diameter, mini tart pans with removable bottoms. Gently press dough into pans and up fluted sides, patch any holes or rips in dough. Trim overhang by running a rolling pin over each tart pan. Transfer dough-lined tart pans to a baking sheet and freeze at least 30 minutes.\nHeat oven to 375\u00b0. Lightly spray four 6-inch square pieces of foil with nonstick cooking spray. Fit foil pieces, greased side down, tightly against each frozen tart shell, letting excess hang over sides. Fill foil-lined tart shells with dried beans or pie weights and bake until crusts are set and just starting to brown, 25 minutes. Remove foil and weights and bake crusts until dry and golden brown, another 5 minutes; transfer to a wire rack and cool completely.\nReduce oven temperature to 350\u00b0F. Remove almond filling from refrigerator and let stand at room temperature for 10 minutes. Line a plate or tray with paper towels, remove pears from poaching liquid and transfer to paper-towel-lined plate, pat dry with additional paper towels. Transfer pears to a cutting board and cut, lengthwise, into \u00bc-inch-thick slices.\nDivide almond filling among cooled tart shells (heaping \u00bc cup per tart) and spread into an even layer. Arrange pear slices on top of filling in a fan-like design, allowing slices to partially overlap. Bake tarts until filling is firm to the touch and crusts are deep golden brown, 40\u201345 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to cool.\nFor the glaze\n, in a small saucepan over medium heat, bring jelly to a boil, stirring to remove lumps.

Start the roast or steak on the hot side of the grill and sear both sides.\nMove the roast or steak to the cooler area of the grill (about medium heat or between 350\u00baF and 375\u00baF) and continue grilling just until it nearly reaches your desired doneness or 125\u00baF for medium-rare (about 15 minutes for a steak and 30 minutes for a roast).\nAllow the steak to rest, loosely tented with foil, for 10\u201315 minutes before slicing and serving.\nBroiled Tri-Tip ROAST\nPreheat a cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat for 5 minutes. Also preheat your oven broiler with the rack set in the upper position.\nPat the roast dry with paper towels then brush with a neutral, high-heat cooking oil (such as vegetable oil or avocado oil) and season generously with kosher salt.\nAdd the roast to the preheated skillet and cook until deeply browned on the first side, about 3 minutes. Flip and cook for another 3 minutes (it gets smoky, so a good vent if ideal).\nTransfer to the top rack in the oven and broil until an instant-read thermometer reaches 125\u00baF (for medium-rare); 5\u20136 more minutes.\nAllow the roast to rest, loosely tented with foil, for 10\u201315 minutes before slicing and serving.\nBroiled Tri-Tip STEAK\nPreheat a cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat for 5 minutes. Also preheat your oven broiler with the rack set in the upper position.\nPat the steak dry with paper towels then brush with a neutral, high-heat cooking oil (such as vegetable oil or avocado oil) and season generously with kosher salt.\nAdd the steak to the preheated skillet and cook until browned on the first side, about 3 minutes.\nFlip and immediately transfer the skillet to the top rack in the oven and broil until an instant-read thermometer reaches 125\u00baF (for medium-rare); about 6 minutes.\nAllow the steak to rest, loosely tented with foil, for 10\u201315 minutes before slicing and serving.\nPan-Seared Tri-Tip STEAK\nPreheat a cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat for 5 minutes. Pat the steaks dry with paper towels then brush them with a neutral, high-heat cooking oil (such as vegetable oil or avocado oil) and season generously with kosher salt.\nAdd the steaks, fat side down, to the preheated skillet (it should sizzle right away) and cook until a crust has formed on the steak and it naturally releases from the pan, about 3 minutes.\nFlip and cooking until a crust forms on the second side and a thermometer inserted in the center of the steak registers 125\u00baF for medium-rare.\nAllow the steak to rest, loosely tented with foil, for 10-15 minutes before slicing and serving.\nOven-Roasted Tri-Tip ROAST\nPreheat your oven to 425\u00b0F with the rack set in the middle position. Place the tri-tip roast on a wire rack inside a roasting pan (or in an oven-proof baking dish).\nRoast until an oven-safe meat thermometer (or instant-read thermometer) registers 125\u00baF for medium-rare. This will take anywhere from 25\u201345 minutes depending on the size of roast you are cooking.\nAllow the roast to rest, loosely tented with foil, for 10\u201315 minutes before slicing and serving.\nSeared Then Roasted Tri-Tip ROAST\nPreheat a cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat for 5 minutes. Pat the roast dry with paper towels then brush it with a neutral, high-heat cooking oil (such as vegetable oil or avocado oil) and season generously with kosher salt.\nAdd the roast, fat side down (if the fat is still intact), to the preheated skillet (it should sizzle right away) and cook until a crust has formed on the roast and it naturally releases from the pan, about 3 minutes.\nFlip the roast then immediately transfer the pan to a 350\u00baF oven and roast until the roast reaches 125\u00baF, about 20 minutes per 2-pound roast (or 10 minutes per pound).\nAllow the roast to rest, loosely tented with foil, for 10\u201315 minutes before slicing and serving.\nSlow-Cooked Tri-Tip ROAST\nPat the roast dry with paper towels then brush with a neautral, high-heat cooking oil (vegetable or avocado oil). Season the tri-tip generously with salt then sear in a hot skillet on all sides.\nTransfer the tri-tip to a crock pot. Deglaze the skillet with a bit of beef broth, scraping up any browned bits. Add the pan juices to the crockpot along with 2 cups of beef broth (and any aromatics you choose).\nCover and cook on low heat for 5\u20136 hours.",

Scatter chilled butter over top and pulse until mixture resembles coarse cornmeal, about 10 pulses. With processor running, add yolk mixture and process until dough just comes together, about 12 seconds.\nRoll dough into an 11-inch circle on a lightly floured surface. Loosely roll dough around rolling pin and gently unroll into a 9-inch tart pan with removable bottom, letting excess dough hang over edge. Ease dough into pan by gently lifting edge of dough with your hand while pressing into corners and fluted sides of pan with your other hand (make sure edges are about \u00bc-inch thick). Run rolling pin over top of pan to remove any excess dough.\nWrap dough-lined pan loosely in plastic, place on a large plate, and freeze until dough is chilled and firm, about 30 minutes.\nAdjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 375\u00b0F. Set dough-lined tart pan on baking sheet, discard plastic and line with a double layer of aluminum foil, covering edges to prevent burning but not tucking under pan; fill with pie weights or dried beans. Bake crust until golden brown and set, 20\u201325 minutes, rotating pan halfway through baking.\nRemove weights and foil and bake until base of crust is dry to touch; about 5 minutes more.\nTransfer crust to a wire rack to cool; decrease oven temperature to 350\u00baF.\nAlmond Filling\nProcess almond flour, sugar, and salt in food processor until combined, about 10 seconds.\nAdd egg and egg white, almond and vanilla extracts; process until combined, about 10 seconds.\nAdd butter and process until no lumps remain, about 20 seconds. Scrape bottom and sides of bowl with rubber spatula and process to combine thoroughly, about 10 seconds more.\nTransfer frangipane to a bowl; press a piece of plastic wrap onto surface of frangipane. Refrigerate until ready to use.\n(Can be refrigerated in airtight container up to 3 days. Before using, let stand at room temperature about 10 minutes to soften; stirring it a few times to loosen the mixture up.)\nPoached Pears\nFor pears, combine apple, sugar, cardamom, and ginger in a saucepan; bring to a boil over high heat then reduce to a simmer over medium. Add pears, bring back to a simmer then reduce to a low simmer and cook, turning occasionally to ensure even poaching, until a toothpick inserted in the thickest part is met with light resistance, this can take anywhere from 20\u201340 minutes depending on type and size of pears, size of saucepan and heat. Some pears may be done before others\u2014remove and transfer them to a bowl as they are finished cooking.\nRemove saucepan from heat; gently remove pears to a bowl. Bring poaching liquid to a boil over high heat then reduce to medium-high and cook, stirring occasionally, until mixture is a deep amber color, reaches 230\u00baF, and measures \u00be cup, 15\u201325 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool completely (save for drizzling over slices before serving).\nAssemble\nSpread frangipane into pre-baked tart crust.\nCut pears in half lengthwise then cut crosswise into thin slices. Arrange pear slices over top of frangipane.\nBake tart at 350\u00baF until golden, 40\u201350 minutes.\nTransfer tart to a wire rack and cool completely.\nOptional: dust tart with confectioners\u2019 sugar and serve with whipped cream and apple/pear caramel sauce.",

Process 1 \u00bc cups (158g) flour, \u00bd cup (66g) confectioners' sugar, and \u00bc teaspoon salt in food processor until combined, about 5 seconds. Scatter 8 tablespoons chilled butter over top and pulse until mixture resembles coarse cornmeal, about 15 pulses. With process running, add egg yolk mixture and process until dough just comes together, about 12 seconds.\nForm dough into 6-inch disk, wrap tightly in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for 1 hour or up to 4 days.\nLet chilled dough sit on counter to soften slightly, about 10 minutes. Roll dough into 11-inch circle on lightly floured counter. Loosely roll dough around rolling pin and gently unroll it onto 9-inch tart pan with removable bottom, letting excess dough hang over edge. Ease dough into pan by gently lifting edge of dough with your hand while pressing into corners and fluted sides of pan with your other hand. Run rolling pin over top of pan to remove any excess dough.\nWrap dough-lined pan loosely in plastic, place on large plate, and freeze until dough is chilled and firm, about 30 minutes.\nAdjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 375\u00baF. Set dough-lined tart pan on baking sheet, line with double layer of aluminum foil, covering edges to prevent burning, and fill with pie weights.\nBake until crust is golden brown and set, about 30 minutes, rotating pan halfway through baking. Remove weights and foil and let crust cool.\nFillings\nAdjust oven rack to middle position and reduce oven heat to 350\u00baF.\nMeasure out 1 tablespoon lemon juice and set aside.\nWhisk remaining 7 tablespoons lemon juice, \u00bc cup lemon zest, 1 egg, 5 yolks, \u2153 cup honey, and pinch salt in medium saucepan until smooth. Cook over medium-low heat, stirring constantly with rubber spatula, until mixture thickens slightly and registers 165\u00baF, about 5 minutes.\nOff heat, whisk in 4 tablespoons chilled butter until melted. Strain lemon curd through fine-mesh strainer into bowl, then gently stir in 2 tablespoons cream with rubber spatula.\nPour warm lemon curd into cooled tart crust. Set tart on baking sheet and bake until filling is shiny and opaque and center jiggles slightly when shaken, 10\u201312 minutes, rotating pan halfway through baking. Transfer tart with baking sheet to wire rack and let cool slightly.\nMeanwhile, process 10 ounces (2 cups) raspberries in a food processor until smooth, about 2 minutes. Strain pur\u00e9e through clean fine-mesh strainer into medium saucepan, pressing on solids to extract as much liquid as possible; discard solids.\nWhisk in remaining \u2153 cup honey and \u215b teaspoon salt. Whisk together 3 tablespoons cornstarch with reserved 1 tablespoon lemon juice and 2 tablespoons water in a small bowl, then whisk into strained raspberry mixture. Bring to simmer over medium-low heat, stirring constantly, and cook until thickened and registers 170\u00baF, about 5 minutes.\nAllow raspberry mixture to cool in pan to 130\u00baF, about 5 minutes; whisking occasionally.\nPour slightly cooled raspberry mixture evenly over cooled lemon filling. Spread into an even layer, then refrigerate until raspberry layer is set and shiny, about 2 hours.\nTo serve, remove outer ring of tart pan, slide thin metal spatula between tart and tart pan bottom, and carefully slide tart onto serving platter or cutting board. Cut into wedges and enjoy.",

    "description": "The best Shrimp Roll Recipe begins by gently poaching the shrimp in a flavorful liquid called a \u201ccourt bouillon\u201d, a combination of water, acid, and aromatics. The chilled shrimp is then tossed in a creamy, elegant dressing with loads of herbs and a little unctuous tang thanks to a hint of sour cream. Finally, soft brioche hot dog buns are toasted in butter until golden brown, soft, and warm. The combination of the chilled creamy shrimp salad and the warm, buttery roll is hard to beat.",

Transfer mixture to a medium bowl.\nDrizzle 3 tablespoons ice water over flour mixture. Using a rubber spatula, mix dough together, pressing against sides of bowl, until a rough dough comes together. If it's still too dry, drizzle in additional water, by tablespoon, just until it comes together.\nDump shaggy dough out onto a large piece of plastic wrap. Form dough into a 4-inch disk, then wrap tightly in plastic and refrigerate at least 30 minutes (or up to 3 days).\nGenerously flour a work surface. Unwrap dough and lightly dust with flour. Roll dough out into an \u215b-inch thick 13-inch round.If dough is too firm, let it sit at room temperature for about 5 minutes before rolling out.\nFold dough in quarters; place corner in center of a 9-inch pie plate. Gently unfold dough to cover plate, using one hand to pick up edges of dough and an index finger to press dough into corners and up sides. Trim dough overhang to \u00bd-inch then tuck edges under and crimp using thumbs and pointer fingers. (*see note on crimping.) Dough edges should be somewhat one top of pan edges (to avoid shrinking during baking).\nRefrigerate dough-lined pie plate for 20 minutes. Prick bottom, sides and corners with a fork. Line dough with a piece of foil, pressing it firmly into corners and sides, and folding over rim. Prick foil about a dozen places with a fork. Refrigerate shell for at least 1 hour or up to 2 days.\nHeat oven to 400\u00baF (204C) with rack set in lowest position.\nPlace pie plate on a baking sheet. Bake shell 15 minutes, pressing down on foil with an oven mitt to deflate when it starts to puff up (this happens for me around 8 or 10 minutes\u2014continue deflating every minute or so after that). Remove foil and continue to bake just until shell is light golden brown, about 10 minutes.\nFilling\nKeep oven heated to 400\u00baF (204\u00baC).\nProcess pumpkin, brown sugar, ginger, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, salt and pepper in a food processor for 1 minute. Transfer pumpkin mixture to a saucepan over medium-high heat and bring to a sputtering simmer, cook, stirring constantly, until thick and shiny, about 5 minutes.\nWhisk mayo and milk into pumpkin and bring to a low simmer; keep warm until the pie shell comes out of the oven.\nProcess eggs in now-empty food processor until foamy, about 5 seconds. With processor running, slowly stream in half of the warm pumpkin mixture. Scrape down sides of bowl as needed, add remaining pumpkin and process 30 seconds more.\nCarefully pour warm filling into warm pie shell, making sure to fill just below edge of crust so it doesn't overflow. (You will likely have excess filling, *see notes.)\nBake pie until filling is puffed, dry-looking, and center slightly wiggles when gently shaken, about 25 minutes. Transfer pie to a wire rack; cool completely before slicing and serving.\nServe with whipped cream.",

Let cool slightly then season to taste with salt; set aside.\nOnce squash is tender, turn oven to broil with rack set 6 inches from heating element. Broil squash until browned, 5-7 minutes. Transfer squash to a platter.\nOn one side of now-empty sheet pan, add halloumi; drizzle lightly with olive oil and sprinkle with \u00bd teaspoon dried rosemary. Add torn bread on other half and toss with 1 teaspoon olive oil to coat. Transfer to upper-middle rack in oven and broil until bread is lightly toasted and halloumi is browned.

Set aside and allow to cool. Once cool, transfer spices to a mortar and pestle (or spice grinder) and grind until fine in texture.\nCombine ground cumin and coriander with 1 teaspoon dried oregano, 1 teaspoon smoked paprika, 1 teaspoon kosher salt and \u00bd teaspoon cayenne pepper; set aside for later.\nTrim 4-pound brisket of any excess fat or sinew (should end up with about 3\u00bd-pounds). Season generously with 2 teaspoons kosher salt and a generous amount of freshly cracked black pepper.\nHeat 1 tablespoon oil in a large* heavy-duty Dutch oven over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add brisket and sear until deeply browned on both sides, about 5\u20137 minutes. Transfer to a plate.\nReduce heat to medium-low and add 1 sliced onion, stirring to deglaze the pan (add a splash or two of beef broth to help things along). Cook until onions are softened, about 5 minutes, then stir in 4 smashed cloves garlic and 2 tablespoons tomato paste. Cook 2 minutes, then stir in remaining beef broth. Cook until thickened and bubbling, 1\u20132 minutes, then stir in prepared spice mixture and 2 bay leaves. Nestle brisket (and any accumulated juices) into Dutch oven, spooning some onions and juices over top.\nCover Dutch oven and transfer to preheated oven. Cook for 3 hours, flipping brisket over halfway through, until brisket is tender and shreds easily with a fork.\nRemove Dutch oven from oven and discard bay leaves. Using two forks, shred meat directly in Dutch oven. Return Dutch oven to oven, uncovered, and cook until liquid reduces slightly and meat is very tender, about 30 minutes. Cover and keep warm until ready to serve.\nTo serve, spoon shredded beef into a soft or hard tortilla and top with sliced avocado, shredded cheese, cabbage, and pickled jalape\u00f1os.\nSlow-Cooker Instructions\nFollow above-instructions through step 5 (you can use a large skillet instead of pot here). Transfer browned brisket to insert of a 5\u20136-quart slow-cooker.\nAdd 1 sliced onion to now-empty skillet, reduce heat to medium-low, stirring to deglaze skillet (add a splash of the beef broth to help things along).

    "instructions": "Grill\nTurn all burners to high, cover, and let grill preheat for about 15 minutes. Brush grill grate clean.\nPat steak dry with paper towels, then season with 1 teaspoon salt and \u00bd teaspoon pepper.\nWhen ready to cook, keep primary burner on high and turn other burners off.\nPlace steak over hot part of grill and cook until beginning to char and beads of moisture appear on edges of steak, 5\u20136 minutes. Flip steak and continue to cook until an instant-read thermometer inserted in the center registers 125\u00baF for medium-rare, about 5 minutes.\nTransfer steak to a clean plate, tent loosely with foil or parchment paper and let rest 10 minutes.\nOven\nHeat oven to 250\u00baF with rack set in middle position. Set a wire rack inside a rimmed baking sheet. Pat steaks dry then season generously with kosher salt. Place steaks on rack and roast until an instant-read thermometer inserted into side of steak registers 90\u00baF\u201395\u00baF, this will take 30\u201350 minutes, flipping the steaks halfway through.\nHeat a generous splash of high-heat cooking oil in a large skillet over high heat until shimmering. Pat steaks dry with paper towels then gently place in skillet and cook, without moving, for 30 seconds. Flip steaks and continue to cook, flipping every 30 seconds, until lightly browned, about 3 minutes.\nAdd a few tablespoons of butter to the skillet. Once melted, tilt the skillet so the butter pools; use a large spoon to spoon the butter up and over the steaks repeatedly (this is called basting). Continue to baste steaks, flipping every 30 seconds, until steaks register 120\u2013125\u00baF for medium-rare, this will take 1\u20133 minutes.\nTransfer steaks to carving board and let rest for 10 minutes. Strain seasoned butter into small bowl; discard solids. Carve steaks off bones, then slice into \u00bc-inch-thick slices. Serve with seasoned butter.\nStove Top\nPreheat a large cast-iron skillet over high for 5 minutes.\nPat steak dry with paper towels, then season with 1 teaspoon salt.\nReduce heat to medium-high. Add a splash of vegetable oil and swirl to coat the pan. Place steak in skillet. Cook until charred and beads of moisture begin to form around edges of steak, about 3 minutes. Flip and continue cooking until an instant-read thermometer inserted in the center registers 125\u00baF for medium-rare, about 3 more minutes. For medium cook to an internal temperature is 135\u00baF, about 4 minutes per side.\nTransfer steak to a clean plate, tent loosely with foil or parchment paper and let rest 10 minutes.\nReverse Sear\nSeason steaks all over with salt (at least 1 teaspoon salt per steak).\nSet steaks on a wire rack set inside a rimmed baking sheet. If you have the time, refrigerate steaks, uncovered, at least 2 hours or up to 12 hours. If you don\u2019t have time, skip this step and move on to step 3.\nHeat oven to 200\u00b0F (93\u00baC). (Or as low as your oven goes. If it\u2019s higher than 200\u00baF the process will take longer).\nCook steaks in oven until an instant-read thermometer registers 105\u00b0F (41\u00b0C) for rare, 115\u00b0F (46\u00b0C) for medium-rare, 125\u00b0F (52\u00b0C) for medium, or 135\u00b0F (57\u00b0C) for medium-well. About 20 minutes for rare and up to 40 minutes for medium-well.\nKeep an eye on internal temperature\u2014a lot of factors can impact cooking time.\nAbout 5 minutes before steaks come out of oven, heat a large cast-iron skillet over high heat until nearly smoking. Once steaks are removed from oven, add 2 tablespoons butter and 2 tablespoons oil to hot skillet; swirling to melt butter and coat skillet.\nAdd steaks, garlic, and rosemary (if using) to skillet and cook until each side is well-browned, about 1 \u00bd minutes per side.\nUsing tongs, hold steaks upright on their sides to sear.\nTransfer steaks to a cutting board and let rest 2 minutes. Slice and enjoy immediately.\nAir Fry\nPreheat airfryer to 400\u00baF.\nPat steak dry with paper towels then season with 1 teaspoon salt.\nPlace steak in air fryer basket and cook until browned and an instant read thermometer inserted in the center registers 120\u2013125\u00baF for medium-rare or 130\u2013135\u00baF for medium, 8\u201312 minutes.\nTransfer steak to a plate and tent with foil; let rest 5 minutes.\nSous Vide\nPreheat a sous vide cooker to desired final temperature (we like 129\u00baF for medium-rare).\nPlace in sous vide bags along with herbs and aromatics (optional). Seal bags and place in water bath for 2\u20133 hours.\nAbout 5 minutes before removing steak from water bath, start preheating a large cast-iron skillet over high.\nOnce the steaks come out of the oven, add a couple tablespoons each butter and oil to the skillet and swirl to coat.\nSear the steaks, flipping every 15 seconds, until a golden crust is formed on each side and desired doneness is reached, about 1 \u00bd minutes total. Serve the steak immediately (no need to rest).",

Lay sheets of foil in pan perpendicular to each other, fold extra foil over edges of pan. Push foil flush to pan, into corners and up sides. Coat with nonstick spray.\nPour \u00be cup (100g) pistachios onto a baking sheet and toast in oven until fragrant and starting to brown, 5\u20138 minutes. Let pistachios cool completely. (I pop mine in the freezer for 10 minutes to quicken the process).\nProcess cooled pistachios, \u00bc cup (50g) sugar, and 2 tablespoons (15g) confectioners\u2019 sugar in food processor until pistachios are finely ground, about 20 seconds. Add \u00be cup (100g) flour, \u00bc teaspoon salt and \u00bc teaspoon cardamom and pulse until combined, about 5 pulses.\nScatter 4 tablespoons butter over top and process until mixture resembles damp sand, about 15 seconds.

Pulse until mixture resembles wet sand and forms a dough when pinched, 5\u201310 pulses. (If the dough is too try, add additional water by teaspoon until a dough forms when pinched.)\nTransfer to a large piece of plastic wrap and gently form dough into a ball; wrap in plastic and flatten into a 5-inch disk. Refrigerate dough until very firm, at least 1 hour.\nGenerously flour a work surface. Unwrap dough and lightly dust with flour. If needed, let dough stand at room temperature until it gives slightly when pressed; 5\u201310 minutes. Roll dough out into an \u215b-inch thick 13-inch round.\nFold dough in quarters; place corner in center of a 9-inch pie plate. Gently unfold dough to cover plate, using one hand to pick up edges of dough and an index finger to press dough into corners and up sides. Trim dough overhang to \u00bd-inch. (Use dough trimmings to patch any thin creased areas caused by folding).\nTuck edges of dough under and crimp using thumbs and pointer fingers.\nFreeze dough-lined pie plate for 20 minutes. Prick bottom, sides and corners with a fork. Line dough with a piece of foil, pressing it flush against the corners, sides, and to cover the rim. Prick foil about a dozen places with a fork. Freeze shell for 30 minutes.\nHeat oven to 400\u00baF (204\u00baC) with rack set in lowest position. Bake shell 25 minutes, pressing down on foil with an oven mitt to flatten if it puffs. Remove foil and continue to bake shell just until it begins to color, about 10 minutes.\nCrumb Topping\nWhile the pie dough is chilling or baking, combine \u00be cup oats, \u2153 cup sliced almonds, \u2153 cup packed brown sugar, \u2153 cup flour, 6 tablespoons melted butter, 1 teaspoon ginger, \u00bc teaspoon nutmeg, and \u00bc teaspoon salt until a stiff dough comes together. Cover and chill until needed.\nFilling\nPlace 3\u00bd cups blueberries and 2 tablespoons lemon juice in medium saucepan. Cook over medium heat, stirring and mashing occasionally with potato masher, until half of blueberries are broken down and mixture measures 1\u00bd\u20131 \u00be cups, about 10 minutes. Off heat, stir in 2 teaspoons lemon zest and \u00bc teaspoon salt; let cool.\nIn a large bowl, combine remaining 3 cups fresh blueberries, cooled cooked blueberry mixture, 1 shredded apple, and 2 tablespoons tapioca that's been ground into a powder. Stir until thoroughly combined.\nTransfer blueberry mixture to warm pie crust.\nPinch crumble topping into \u00bd-inch pieces and sprinkle evenly over filling.\nSet pie on a baking sheet and bake on lowest rack at 400\u00baF (204\u00baC) until crust is light golden brown, 15\u201318 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 350\u00baF (177\u00baC), rotate sheet, and continue to bake pie until crust and topping is deep golden brown, about 25 minutes more.\nLet pie cool on wire rack until juices have thickened, about 2 hours.

Remove hens, rinse thoroughly, and pat dry; prick skin all over breast and legs with point of a paring knife.\nMash together 5 tablespoons butter, 1 tablespoon sage, thyme, rosemary, \u00bd teaspoon salt and \u00bc teaspoon pepper in a small bowl; set aside.\nWild Rice Stuffing\nMeanwhile, for the stuffing, bring water to a boil in a medium saucepan. Stir in rice, bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low, cover and simmer until rice is cooked and fluffy, about 40 minutes.\nHeat 2 tablespoons butter in a medium saut\u00e9 pan over medium-high. Add shallots, carrot, and celery; season with \u00bc teaspoon salt and a pinch pepper; cook until vegetables are softened and starting to brown, 6\u20138 minutes. Stir in sage and cook 1 minute.\nAdd cooked rice, cherries, parsley and vinegar, reduce heat to low and cook until warmed through. Remove from heat and set aside (or refrigerate) until ready to stuff hens.\nCornish Hens\nFor the hens, adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 400\u00baF (204\u00baC). Place a wire rack inside a large rimmed baking sheet (at least 19-by-13\u2013inch). Reheat stuffing in a saut\u00e9 pan until steaming.\nSpoon \u00bd cup hot stuffing into cavity of each hen; tie each hens legs together with 6-inch piece of kitchen twine. Leaving as much space as possible between each hen, arrange them breast side down and wings facing out, on prepared rack-lined baking sheet. Roast until backs are golden brown, about 25 minutes.\nRemove sheet from oven, spread 1 teaspoon herb butter over back of each hen. Turn hens breast side up and wings facing out, and spread 2 teaspoons herb butter over breast and leg area of each hen. Return pan to oven, add 1 cup water to sheet pan, and roast until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the stuffed cavity registers about 150\u00baF (65\u00baC), about 20\u201330 minutes.\nRemove pan from oven again and spread 1 teaspoon herb butter over breast and leg area of each hen. Return sheet to oven, add another \u00bd cup water to sheet and increase oven temperature to 450\u00baF (232\u00baC).\nRoast until hens are spotty brown and cavity registers 160\u00baF (71\u00baC), 15\u201320 minutes more, depending on hen size. (You can also check thickest parts of breast, which should register 165\u00baF, and thickest part of thigh, which should register 170\u00baF). Remove hens from oven, spread remaining butter over each hen and rest 10 minutes.\nGravy\nMeanwhile, pour drippings into a liquid measuring cup. Skim 3 tablespoons fat off top and add to a small saucepan over medium heat. Skim and discard remaining fat from drippings.\nAdd flour to saucepan with fat and cook 2 minutes, whisking constantly. Slowly add remaining drippings, wine, and broth and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium and cook until thickened, 5\u20138 minutes. Strain gravy through a fine mesh strainer into a serving dish or gravy boat.\nServe cornish hens with gravy.",
