      "In the bowl of a stand mixer with a dough hook attachment, combine the sticky rice good, bread flour, egg and egg white, sugar, yeast and salt. Knead on low speed until the mixture comes together into a sticky dough (the dough may seem dry at first, but do not add water).",
      "Add the butter, scraping the sides and bottom of bowl to ghelp the butter incorporate evenly, and knead for 7 to 8 minutes, until the dough is extremely smooth and elastic. The dough should be sticky, but only sticking to the bottom of the bowlas the machine is running, leaving a thin opaque film on the sides of the bowl. It i;s too wet\u2014sticking everywhere as the machine is running\u2014add 1 tablespoon of bread flour at a time and knead again until it looks right.",
      "Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let the dough rise at room temperature until doubled, 2 to 3 hours.",
      "Shape the donuts",
      "Dust the working surface with flour, then roll the dough into a large sheet about \u215c inch (1cm) thick. Use a 4-inch (10-cm) dough doughnut cutter to cut out donuts. You can do it with or without doughnut holes.",
      "Cut out a 5-inch (13-c) square of parchment paper for each doughnut. Transfer the donuts onto the squares, set them aside on large sheet pans, and cover loosely with plastic wrap. Let them rise again until doubled (this will mostly show in thickness instead of width), 1 \u00bd to 2 hours.",
      "Make the glaze and topping",
      "Meanwhile, combine the honey, butter, and sea salt in a small saucepan and cook over low heat, stirring constantly, until the mixture has come to a simmer and the butter is melted. Set aside to let cool to room temperature and thicken.",
      "Mix the cardamom and cinnamon in a small bowl and set aside.",
      "Fry the donuts",
      "When the donuts are proofed, add 1 \u00bd inches (4 cm) of canola oil to a deep frying pan. Heat over medium-high heat until the oil reaches 325\u00b0F/160\u00b0C.",
      "Life one parchment paper with a doughnut on it and gently lower it into the frying oil (including the parchment). Use a fork or chopsticks (I used tongs) to press the parchment paper down do the hot oil can flood the bottom of the doughnut, which will release it from the parchment. When the parchment is free, remove with tongs. Fry until one side of the doughnut is golden brown, about 1 minute, then flip and fry until the other side is golden brown, about 1 minute more.",
      "If it takes way faster or slower than 1 minute for each side of the doughnut to brown, the oil, is either too hot or too cold. Adjust accordingly.",
      "Drain well (I used a spider, but a slotted spoon would work too) and set aside on a cooling rack. Repeat to make the rest of the donuts.",
      "To serve",
